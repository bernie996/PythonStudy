An iterable object is some kind of collection of items, for instance: a list of numbers, a string of characters, a range, etc.
"item" is a new variable that can be called whatever you want
"item" references the current position of our iterator within the iterable. It will iterate over (run through) every item of 
the collection and then go away when it has visited all items
