Modules

#They help in reduce the large of the files
#Reuse code across multiple files by importing
#Modules are just python files

--------------------------------------------------------------
Built-In Modules

They can be called using "import" and their methods can be acceced
ussing the next format:

import name_of_the_module
 name_of_the_module.name_of_the_method(parameters_if_needed)


-The module can be also renamed while being call:

import name_of_the_module as short_name:
short_name.name_of_the_method()
-------------------------------------------------------------

Importing Only Parts of a Module

As a key rule, it's a good practice to import only the necessary
It can be done using the keyword "from":

from name_of_the_module import name_of_the_method


-The individual modules can be also renamed:

from module_name import module1 as md1, module2 as md2


-But, if is necessary import all the methods:

from name_of_the_module import *pattern
